If we are not using any decorator :
-----------------------------------
For class method , @classmethod decorator is mandatory.
For static method , @staticmethod decorator is optional.

Eg1:
class Test:
        def m1():
           print('Some method')
t = Test()
t1.m1()

TypeError: m1() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given.

In above example, Python will consider the method as instance method, but we are not declaring
self variable.
